Useful Music
============

Application to sell sheet music and associated audio tracks.

## Installation

```sh
# Clone this repository
git clone git@github.com:CrowdHailer/useful-music.git
cd useful-music

# start up the development environment
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
```

## Development

This is a migration of a Ruby project to an elixir project.
All the elixir code is in the `project` directory.
Ruby code will only be deleted once the functionality has been migrated.

## Notes

- maybe project should be renamed development and mapped directly to the vagrant file.
